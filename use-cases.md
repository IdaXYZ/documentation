# Use cases

Online Payments - Ecommerce and point of sale are two of the areas where Request Network is advantageous when compared to current payment methods. The traditional system has large fees and privacy concerns. Request limits the amount in fees that must be paid and forces the payer to agree to a payment before it is made. A payment request is at the core of the protocol. The first implementation of online payments was the Pay with Request JS button. From there Ecommerce Plugins were made for Woo Commerce and Shopify sites. 

Invoicing - One of the benefits of Request Network is its documentation of payments. An invoice app was made at app.request.network which works with standard requests and will accommodate extensions such as escrow management. Peer to peer and business to business are two situations in which invoices are beneficial. Invoices also collect data for use in accounting applications. 

Audit & Accounting - Both small and large businesses need excellent accounting tools to keep track of finances. Transactions sent through Request Network are documented and immutable. This allows accounting apps and smart auditing algorithms to be built on top of Request with confidence. The first implementation of an Accounting app is being built by the Request Network Foundation. 

Internet of Things - The Request protocol was designed as flexible as possible for clear interaction between Internet of Things and financial flows. Integration into existing IoT platforms, such as IBM Watson, is a use condition. 

Transparency - While Request will have privacy options, it will also allow organizations to be transparent about their financial operations. This is especially useful for governments to show their spending and income in a trusted manner for the average citizen to see.
