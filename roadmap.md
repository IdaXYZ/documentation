# Roadmap

_From Solid to Fluid, we’ve melted the roadmap. You can now track what we’re working on at the Request Network Foundation in real-time, at any time. This gives you the ability to discover our priorities of the past, today and the future with information that is accurate and open for all. The new roadmap will be dynamic, meaning it will keep changing based on learnings from the team and blockchain ecosystem as a whole._ 

The blockchain landscape is a highly dynamic environment, filled with lots of innovation on a daily basis. Blockchain technology development is evolving and so is the Request Network. We are expanding Request Network into a universal financial application ecosystem, interoperable with all blockchains.

To achieve this and rapidly scale as an organisation according to the current demand by real businesses to adopt blockchain technology, we have reimagined the Request Network roadmap to become progress based, rather than time based as it used to be until today. 

> **Out with the old, in with the new.**

The new roadmap allows for a more agile development and business environment. It allows the teams to react more quickly when they discover a new opportunity that contributes to reaching the foundation mission & vision.

Below you find the visualization of the new Request Network roadmap. A roadmap that is built for fluid development & priority shifting according to real world needs, which will be ever evolving as the Request Network ecosystem progresses. Any milestone that is listed on our roadmap will be subject to change, according to ecosystem priorities and learnings made by the team.

**Any milestone that was listed on the old roadmap** which is not currently listed on the new roadmap can still be added at a later stage, once we prioritize spending real resources on the development. Old milestones may also have been merged, for instance: _‘Add management of fiat-currencies to Request’_ is now added under the Up Next status, merged into the bigger _Supporting more currencies_ goal_._ **This is the launch of the new roadmap. New goals will keep being added along the way.**

**How our roadmap flow works**

To keep progression tracking as simple as possible for you, we’ve divided our roadmap into separate _Themes._ Each _theme_ hosts its own set of goals, which will either be showing the status ‘in-progress’, ‘up next’ or ‘completed’, always contributing to the bigger thematic goal. **The order of goals within each separate status block is not a representation of the priority we give them.** 

For instance, when looking at new roadmap below the _Protocol Development theme,_ In-progress goal today are _multiple scaling solutions, data-encryption for transactions, data sustainability and data formats specifications_. The next up goals are _Extensibility and advanced payment conditions extension, request explorer, cross-currency support_ and _more currency support._ The delivered goals, already reached, are the implementation of Bitcoin & ERC20 support, Improved JS Library usability, release mainnet and release testnet.   
Goals might be merged over time to keep the roadmap clean.

This makes it possible to quickly discover the latest progress that is being made in real-time. When one or multiple goals are reached, they will move from in-progress towards delivered, contributing to the historical roadmap of the Request Network. A new \(set of\) goal\(s\) from the ‘Up Next’ section will simultaneously shift to in-progress, which the team will then spend their resources on. This way we can keep \(re-\)prioritizing goals to work on next, making the foundation a lot more agile on leading the way to a universal financial application ecosystem while giving you the most accurate state of development.

The two themes we have set up for launching the new roadmap are listed below, including a description of which type of goals they will include and its bigger thematic goal. The list of themes will change over time as bigger goals get reached, or new themes join the roadmap:

_- Protocol Development  
- App Development_

**Protocol Development  
Thematic goal:** _Create an open-source and interoperable financial application blockchain protocol, to be taken advantage of by app developers without permission_

The Protocol Development theme will track all development that is currently in-progress \(or has been delivered\) contributing directly to the protocol of the Request Network. The Request Network protocol will serve as the engine on which the Request Network applications will run. It gives app developers all the decentralized tools needed to build their own financial application without third party permission.  
   
Development made here contributes to the thematic goal, increasing the robustness of the core and extension layers and is carried out by the core development team of the foundation. The development goals which are listed under the Protocol Development theme are focused on:  
- _Increasing Data Privacy & Security  
- Expanding Protocol Extensions & Features_  
- _Enabling_ _Interoperability & Scaling._

**App Development  
Thematic Goal:** _Grow adoption, awareness and use of the Request Network ecosystem, by creating applications on top of the protocol._

The App Development theme will track all development that is currently in-progress \(or has been delivered\) contributing to developing and delivering successful financial applications that leverage the Request Network protocol. To keep it simple, this theme only tracks development made by direct team members and does not show outside community development.

Several app development squads, consisting of a product manager, an agile coach and team members work on an iteration of the use-cases earlier stated in our mind map. These teams will be supported by the foundation through knowledge and operational support, with the goal to become a self sustaining business with a legitimate business model & go-to-market plan. 

The development goals that are listed under the App Development theme are currently focused on:  
_- Delivering the Crowdfunding Application  
- Delivering the Payments Application  
- Delivering the Accounting Application_

The reformed roadmap will always contribute to achieving the long term Request Network Foundation’s mission. We reinvent how we experience payments, rebuild trust and integrity in the financial industry and are at the forefront of financial inclusion. We inspire and educate companies, developers and entrepreneurs to use the Request Network protocol and build an ecosystem of financial applications together that is open source, seamless and interoperable in a more global economy.
