# Up Next

### Extensibility and advanced payment conditions extension

**Goal:** Build a system that allows the protocol to be extended. This includes extensions built by the internal team but also by anybody, while maintaining security and integrity of the protocol. The first extension will be “advanced payment conditions”, to set conditions on the amounts and times to pay a request for example. Later, escrows, extensions for ICOs and continuous payments are candidates.

### Request explorer

**Goal:** Online dashboard to explore the protocol, the requests, amounts, currencies, etc.

### Cross-currency

**Goal:** Ability to pay a request in a different currency than asked by the recipient

### Supporting more currencies

**Goal:** Broad subject, that will start with documenting how to add currencies, so that developers from the community can add the currencies they need. It also includes research on fiat integration
