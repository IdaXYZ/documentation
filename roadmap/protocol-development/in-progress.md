# In Progress

### **Scaling solution**

**Goal:** To improve the limit on the number of created request per second, and make these creation much much cheaper, weâ€™re doing research and prototyping on scaling solutions. This includes options like Tendermint and Plasma. The subject is complex and it will take time to reach a final solution.

### Data encryption

**Goal:** Researching and implementing a solution to hide the data but also the amounts and addresses. This subject is also complex.

### Data sustainability

**Goal:** Setting up IPFS nodes alongside a monitoring system to ensure request data are always available

### Data Format Specifications

**Goal:** Release standards for request data formats
